  <p>My name is Prabhdeep Singh . I always find my happiness while performing music and when people listen to my music<em>too</em>  as in my early childhood i used to listen late 90's music and always used to adore it and eventually in high school days used to perform in music competitions . </p> 

<p>Here I am going to discuss about things that i did after my  high schools and before coming to Canada . I did the most important thing which usually every person forgets to do and that is giving yourself some time to explore your qualities and i spent that time very wisely by composing and recording my own musical pieces . Also i had interest in Web Development, so then i also did computer diploma in which i gain more knowledge . Talking about hobbies my hobbies are to write poetry and read novels everyday without these to things i find mt day incomplete.</p></h></div>
